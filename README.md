# SimpleDI
DI and IOC Concept

use 3 platform to show DI/IOC basic concept.

1. I write Model, Interface, Business Logic in 1 project.
2. I create Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android and ASP.NET Form project to show how to use these patterns in the specified platform.

I'll create samples base on this project :
1. Model-View-Presentor
2. Model-View-ViewModel

We create these design patterns to help us clean code, not to confuse ourselves.
